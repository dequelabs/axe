**axe tools** help you check for digital accessibility. They are built on the open-source [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility engine for automated Web UI testing.  To make it easy to get started, it is available as:
* Free browser extensions
* Open-source CLI
* APIs for JavaScript, Java, and Ruby


## Free browser extensions
