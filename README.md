The **axe** family of tools help you check for digital accessibility. They are built on the open-source [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility engine for automated Web UI testing.  To make it easy to get started, it is available as:
* Free browser extensions
* Open-source CLI
* APIs for JavaScript, Java, and Ruby


## Free browser extensions
Perform **interactive testing** extensions to the Developer tools built into the browser:
* [Download at the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-web-accessibility-tes/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?hl=en-US)
* [Download at the Firefox Browser ADD-ONS site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/)


## CLI
Use the command line interface to easily add accessibility checks into your **build/integration scripts**. 
* Install the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-cli) and begin to use it immediately
* Or, clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-cli) and modify it to your heart's content :-)


## APIs
All built on the foundation of [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), these APIs make integration with your testing framework easier:
* [axe-puppeteer](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-puppeteer) chainable API, automatically tests every frame, for **Puppeteer** tests
* [axe-webdriverjs](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-webdriverjs) the same for **Selenium WebDriverJS**
* [axe-selenium-java](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-selenium-java) for our **Java** friends
* [axe-matchers](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-matchers) for our friends using **Cucumber** or **RSpec**
* [react-axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/react-axe) for testing your **React** apps
